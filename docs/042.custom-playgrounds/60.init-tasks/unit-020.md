title: Startup files and welcome messages

name: startup-files
kind: unit

For small tweaks - shell profiles, config files, seed data, helper scripts - a full init task is overkill.
`playground.startupFiles` is a list of files baked into the playground's machines **before they boot**:

```yaml
playground:
  startupFiles:
    - path: /home/laborant/.bashrc
      append: true
      content: |
        export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin
        export GOPATH=$HOME/go/

    - path: /etc/app/config.yaml
      owner: laborant
      mode: "600"
      content: |
        environment: playground
      machines: [dev-01]        # optional; omitted = every machine of the play
```

- `path` must be absolute; missing parent directories are created.
- `append: true` adds to an existing file instead of replacing it - the go-to for `.bashrc` and similar modifications.
- Every entry needs `append: true` or both `owner` and `mode` set. `owner` (`user`, `user:group`, or numeric IDs) and `mode` (octal, without the leading zero - e.g. `"600"`) default to `root`-owned `"644"` when the file is created, and are kept unchanged when appending.
- `machines` restricts an entry to the named machines; omit it to apply the entry to every machine in the play.

At most 20 entries per manifest.

Startup files is the only reliable way to customize login shell behavior (e.g., by placing something in the `~/.bashrc` file). Init tasks run already _after_ the machine is booted, and technically, the user may acquire a shell before all init tasks complete.
::

Rule of thumb: use startup files for *content you already know at authoring time* (configs, aliases, seed data, helper scripts),
and [init tasks](/docs/custom-playgrounds/init-tasks#init-tasks) for anything that must be *executed* (installing packages, starting services).

## Fetching files instead of inlining them

Instead of `content`, a `source` fetches the file rather than inlining its bytes - or, with `extract: true`, unpacks a tar archive into a destination directory:

```yaml
playground:
  startupFiles:
    # A helper script from this content's own __static__ folder.
    - path: /usr/local/bin/setup.sh
      source: __static__/setup.sh
      owner: root
      mode: "755"

    # A tar archive extracted into a destination directory, created if missing.
    - path: /opt/app            # destination directory
      source: __static__/app.tar.gz
      extract: true
      owner: laborant

    # Any https URL - GitHub raw content is the typical case.
    - path: /usr/local/bin/cdebug
      source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iximiuz/cdebug/main/hack/install.sh
      owner: root
      mode: "755"
```

- `content` and `source` are mutually exclusive - exactly one of them per entry.
- Files are fetched and cached by the platform, so a startup file always reflects the current source without any cache-busting on your part.
- `extract: true` unpacks a `source` archive - `.tar`, or gzip-compressed `.tar.gz`/`.tgz` (no other compression is supported) - into `path` before the machine boots, running in an isolated sandbox; `owner` sets who owns the extracted files (default `root`), and `mode`, `append`, and `content` can't be combined with `extract`.
- `labctl content push` builds the archive for you when a startup file points at `__static__/<folder>.tar.gz` (or `.tgz`/`.tar`) and a `<folder>/` directory exists next to the declaring `index.md` (or `manifest.yaml`): the folder's files are tarred on every push, and on every change in `--watch` mode, so the folder is the source of truth and the archive needs no build step. Keep the folder itself out of the push with `.labctlignore` - `labctl` watches it regardless.
- Limits: at most 1 GiB per fetched file.

`machines[].startupFiles` (declared inside a machine, rather than at the top of `playground:`) still works - it's the original, "legacy" form. It can be combined with the playground-level form: existing manifests using it keep working unchanged and are never reformatted, but the playground-level list shown above is recommended for new manifests. When both are present for a machine, the playground-level entries are applied first, then that machine's own `startupFiles`.

## Welcome messages

The first thing a user sees in a terminal is the machine's welcome message. It's configured per user and is well worth the effort -
a good welcome message explains what the machine is, what's installed, and where to start:

```yaml
      users:
        - name: laborant
          default: true
          welcome: |
            This is a development machine with Go, Docker, and kubectl preinstalled.
            The demo app lives in ~/app - run `make help` to see what it can do.
```

Set `welcome: '-'` to suppress the message entirely (useful for secondary machines).
