# PLAYGROUND CONFIGURATION
#
# Each tutorial can have an accompanying playground.
# The playground object below defines the base playground name
# and the machine, tab, and container registry customizations.
#
# See https://labs.iximiuz.com/api/playgrounds?filter=base for the
# full list of available base playgrounds.
playground:
  # Name of the base playground is the only required attribute.
  name: k3s

  # Startup files are baked into the playground's machine filesystems before
  # they boot, so it's a perfect place to pre-configure a machine before the
  # very first init task or login session starts. Up to 20 entries per manifest.
  startupFiles:
    - path: /home/laborant/.bashrc
      content: |
        export SOME_ENV_VAR=some-value

        export PS1='\u@\h:\w (overwritten)\$ '

      append: true # skip if the file needs to be overwritten (or created)
      # owner: UID:GID # default: 0:0 if append is false, otherwise the file owner is kept
      # mode: <octal>   # default: "644" if append is false, otherwise the file mode is kept
      machines: [dev-machine] # optional; omitted = every machine of the play

    # A file fetched instead of inlined: from this content's own __static__
    # folder, or from an https URL.
    # - path: /usr/local/bin/setup.sh
    #   source: __static__/setup.sh
    #   owner: root
    #   mode: "755"

    # A tar/tar.gz/tgz source unpacked into path before the machine boots
    # (owner defaults to root). labctl builds __static__/<folder>.tar.gz from
    # a sibling <folder>/ directory on every `labctl content push`, so keep
    # the sources in the folder (and .labctlignore it) - no build step needed.
    # - path: /home/laborant/app
    #   source: __static__/app.tar.gz
    #   extract: true
    #   owner: laborant

  # List available machines. By default, all playground machines are available,
  # but once you define the `machines` attribute, only the explicitly listed
  # subset of machines will be added to the playground.
  machines:
  - name: dev-machine
    # Override default resources (cannot be above the limits of the playground)
    resources:
      cpuCount: 1
      ramSize: "1Gi"
    # users: ...
    # noSSH: ...

  - name: cplane-01
    # Override the default login user and set a custom welcome message.
    users:
    - name: root
      default: true
      # Use a special value '-' to disable the welcome message completely.
      welcome: Welcome to the control plane node.

  - name: node-01
    # Include machine in the playground but disable SSH access to it
    # (automatically disables the terminal UI tab).
    noSSH: true

  # This machine is intentionally not listed, meaning that it won't be available
  # in the content's playground (even though it's part of the base playground).
  # - name: node-02

  # List available tabs. By default IDE, kexp if playground is about Kubernetes,
  # and one terminal tab per machine will be used. However, if the `tabs` attribute
  # is defined, the explicitly listed set of tabs will be used instead.
  tabs:
  - kind: ide            # enable the online IDE (code-server)
  - kind: kexp           # enable the Kubernetes Visualizer (kexp)

  - machine: dev-machine # 'dev-machine' and 'cplane-01' are hostnames
  - machine: cplane-01   # 'kind: terminal' is implied

  - kind: http-port      # expose a web app listening on machine's port as an iframe tab
    name: Nginx          # user-defined name of the tab
    number: 30080        # port number to expose
    machine: node-01     # machine to expose the port on
    # tls: true          # enable TLS if the target service uses HTTPS
    # pane: right        # show in the right pane of the split-screen view (default: left)
    # target: window     # or open in a new browser tab instead of an embedded pane
                         # (for pages that refuse to load in an iframe); no pane then

  - kind: web-page       # embed an external web page as an iframe tab
    name: example.com    # user-defined name of the tab
    url: https://example.com
    # pane: right        # same options are available for web-page tabs
    # target: window

  # Protect the playground's registry (registry.iximiuz.com)
  # with a username and password. Default: no authentication,
  # but the registry is only reachable from the playground.
  registryAuth: user:password


# PLAYGROUND TASKS
#
# The `tasks` attribute is optional. If defined, the listed
# set of tasks will be executed on the tutorial's playground.
#
# There types of tasks currently supported:
# - init: executed once on the playground initialization
# - regular: executed in a loop until they complete (exit with code 0).
# - helper: executed in a loop indefinitely, performing miscellaneous
#           background jobs.
tasks:
  init_deploy_nginx:
    # Init tasks are used to finalize the setup of the playground.
    # Until all init tasks are completed, the playground screen shows
    # a loading animation.
    init: true

    # By default, the task is executed on every machine of the playground.
    # If the task needs to be executed only on a specific machine, you
    # can specify it with the `machine` property. Beware, at the moment,
    # either none or all tasks must have the `machine` property (in the latter case,
    # different tasks may be executed on different machines).
    machine: dev-machine

    # By default, tasks are executed as the `root` user.
    # If the task needs to be executed as a different user, you
    # can specify it with the `user` property.
    user: laborant

    run: |
      kubectl run nginx-01 --image=ghcr.io/iximiuz/labs/nginx:alpine --port=80

  init_expose_nginx:
    init: true
    machine: dev-machine
    # Init tasks run in parallel but before all regular tasks.
    # If the sequence of the init tasks is important,
    # you can specify the `needs` property.
    needs:
      - init_deploy_nginx
    run: |
      kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod nginx-01

      kubectl expose pod nginx-01 --port=80 --type=NodePort \
        --overrides '{ "apiVersion": "v1","spec":{"ports": [{"port":80,"protocol":"TCP","targetPort":80,"nodePort":30080}]}}'

    # By default, the task will time out after 10 seconds. If you expect a particular
    # check to take longer (or it intentionally should time out faster), you can
    # configure the timeout with the `timeout_seconds` property.
    timeout_seconds: 90

  # Regular tasks are used to check if certain system conditions are met
  # and/or requested user actions are completed. Each regular task should
  # have a visual representation in the content's body, and the total/done
  # number of regular tasks is displayed in the content's header, serving
  # as a main content completion indicator.
  verify_file_exists:
    machine: dev-machine
    # The only mandatory property of a regular task is the `run` script.

        exit 1
      fi

  # Tasks can also be used to collect user input. While it's up to the task's
  # author to decide what to do with the input, the input is usually done via
  # some well-known file (the task's UI element and the task's `run` script
  # should agree on the file name beforehand).
  # The task's `run` script can do anything with the provided user input.
  input_container_name:
    machine: dev-machine
    # This task just echoes the user input (but usually, you'd want to assert
    # something about the input).
    run: |

      echo "x(.input)"

      # If the `destination` property is set, user input is also stored in the file.

        echo "The container isn't running."
        exit 1
      fi

  # Ready tasks are executed in a loop until they either complete (exit with 0)
  # or fail (exiting with a non-zero code doesn't mean failure, see failcheck for

    # (playground-wide) conditions are still met. If the failcheck exits

This is a self-documenting sample that serves as a guide on how to author **tutorials** on iximiuz Labs.
You can find the source of this document on [GitHub](https://github.com/iximiuz/labs/tree/main/content-samples/sample-tutorial).
Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own tutorials.


## What is a Tutorial on iximiuz Labs?

Tutorials are deep dives into DevOps and server-side topics where theory blends with hands-on examples.
You can think of them as a **combination of a traditional blog post and a Linux playground**.
A tutorial can be just a few paragraphs long or as large as a book (but in the latter case,
please consider splitting it into multiple tutorials or turning it into a [course](/new/course)).

What makes iximiuz Labs tutorials special:

- Explanatory drawings, screenshots, and diagrams.
- Reproducible shell commands and code snippets.
- Interactive tasks with immediate feedback.
- Ability to access the playground directly from the browser.
- Complementary [challenges](/new/challenge) for more comprehensive learning experience.

Assuming the tutorial is published and accessible (see _access control_ below),
non-authenticated users are typically allowed to read the tutorial's content,
while authenticated users can start the tutorial's playground and mark the tutorial as completed,
with the corresponding progress reflected in their personal dashboard.


## How to Edit the Tutorial

At the moment, iximiuz Labs does not offer a WYSIWYG editor.
Instead, content editing is expected to be done on your local machine,
while the changes are real-time streamed to the page by [`labctl`](https://github.com/iximiuz/labctl),
providing immediate feedback via the traditional _hot-reloading_ experience.

This approach allows you to write content in your favorite markdown editor or even a full-fledged IDE,
keeping the full control over the raw content source and staying out of the way of any AI-powered features of your editor.

::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---

We encourage you to store the source of your tutorials in a git repository,
similarly to how you manage code projects.
This way, you can benefit from the versioning and backup features of git.
::

To get the up-to-date instructions on how to install and use `labctl`,
click "Open in Editor" button in the tutorial's menu:

![Open in Editor](__static__/open-in-editor.png)


## How to Control Tutorial Access

Authors can control who can _list_, _preview_, _read_, and _start_ their tutorials.
Every tutorial starts as a **private** draft, meaning only the author can access it.
When the tutorial is ready, the author can choose to make it **public**
(accessible to everyone with the link) or configure _more granular_ access.

The access control settings can be opened from the tutorial's menu:

![Controlling tutorial access](__static__/tutorial-access-control.png)

::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---

While publication via a direct link is always possible,
the iximiuz Labs team reserves the right to choose which tutorials will be listed in the [catalog(s)](/tutorials?filter=community).
**Setting `canList` to `["anyone"]` is treated only as an indicator of the author's willingness to list the tutorial in one of the platform's catalogs.**
Authors can explicitly prohibit listing by setting the `canList` attribute to `["owner"]`.
::


## Tutorial Metadata and Front Matter

Every tutorial is represented by a markdown file that begins with a YAML _front matter_ block.
The smallest possible front matter block for a tutorial should contain the following fields:

```yaml [my-tutorial/index.md]
---
kind: tutorial
title: My Awesome Linux Containers Tutorial
description: |
  A deep dive into managing containers with practical, hands-on examples.

categories:
  - linux
  - containers

tagz:
  - example
  - tutorial-docs

createdAt: 2025-03-26

cover: <image filename from the __static__ folder>
---
```

The above fields are essential because they feed the platform with information used for indexing, navigation, and displaying your tutorial.
However, iximiuz Labs also supports a number of additional fields that can be used to:

- Specify the tutorial's playground and its customization options.
- Define _init_, _helper_, and _verification_ tasks to be executed on the playground's VMs.
- List accompanying _challenges_, _tutorials_, _skill paths_, and _playgrounds_ to later embed them as cards in the tutorial's body.

## Tutorial Markdown

The _front matter_ section is followed by the markdown content of the tutorial.
All standard markdown elements are supported, including:

- Bold, italic, and underlined text.
- Headings and subheadings.
- Paragraphs, lists, tables, etc.
- Code blocks with optional syntax highlighting.
- Image embedding with the `![alt](src)` syntax.
- Relative and absolute links with the `[text](url)` syntax.

In addition, iximiuz Labs extends standard markdown with rich visual and interactive components (see [MDC](https://nuxt.com/modules/mdc)).

### Content Folder Structure

For convenience, iximiuz Labs allows authors to store any files related to the tutorial in the same directory as the tutorial's markdown file.
Here is a typical folder structure for a tutorial:

```text
my-tutorial/
├── index.md
├── ...other files...
└── __static__
    ├── cover.png
    └── image.png
```

All files in the `my-tutorial` directory are automatically uploaded to the remote content storage by `labctl`.
This is handy when you need to accompany the tutorial with some helper scripts, internal notes and drafts, etc.

**Files other than the markdown content (i.e., `index.md`) and the static assets sub-folder are not accessible via the API**,
so you are free to store any files in the tutorial's directory that are not intended to be seen by the users.

At the same time, the `__static__` sub-folder is a special folder that is automatically uploaded to the CDN
and can be referenced in the tutorial's markdown using the `__static__` prefix to:

- Embed images (see [How to Embed Images](#how-to-embed-images) below)
- Expose files (e.g., helper scripts) to be downloaded by the playground VMs
- Bake files (or whole directories) straight into a playground VM before it boots, via `playground.startupFiles` with `source: __static__/<path>` - see [Startup files](/docs/custom-playgrounds/init-tasks#startup-files)

**Unlike other files in the tutorial's directory, the `__static__` folder is publicly accessible**,
so you should not put any internal use-only information in it.

::remark-box
---
kind: error
---

### WARNING - UNPROTECTED ASSETS

⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not put any sensitive information in `__static__` folder&nbsp;&nbsp;️⚠️

While the markdown content of tutorials (or any other forms of content on iximiuz Labs)
is subject to full authorization checks,
the static assets are not. This limitation is due to the extensive
use of CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) to deliver static assets with the best
possible performance in all regions of the world.

With some careful URL-construction, files placed in the `__static__`
folder can be fetched via the API by potentially unauthorized users.
This includes anonymous users, bots, and crawlers. The caching duration
of these assets is also very long (up to 1 year).

If you wish to store private files alongside the content, make sure
to place them outside of the `__static__` folder.
::

### How to Embed Images

All images referenced in the tutorial's markdown must be stored in the `__static__` directory next to the `index.md` file,
and their paths in the `src` attributes must be relative and start with `__static__`.
The `labctl content push` command will automatically upload all images from the static directory,
and the relative paths will be substituted with the actual URLs when the tutorial is rendered as a web page.

While the standard markdown syntax for embedding images is supported,
iximiuz Labs also offers two rich MDC components for embedding images.

#### Zoom-able Images with the `image-box` Component

```markdown
::image-box
---
:src: <image-name>.(png|jpg|...)
:alt: '<short image description>'
:max-width: 1000px # optional
:margin: 0px auto  # optional
:padding: 10px     # optional
:float: left|right # optional
---

_Optional caption goes here._
::
```

Example:

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/docker-run.png
:alt: 'Docker run command under the hood: pulling the image, creating a container, attaching...'
:max-width: 600px
---

_Click on the image to zoom in._
::


#### Slide Show with the `slide-show` Component

```markdown
::slide-show
---
slides:
- image: <image1>.(png|jpg|...)
  alt: <description of the first image>
- image: <image2>.(png|jpg|...)
  alt: <description of the second image>
- ...
---
::
```

Example:

::slide-show
---
slides:
- image: __static__/builder-pattern-go.png
  alt: "Builder Pattern for a Go application."
- image: __static__/builder-pattern-nodejs.png
  alt: "Builder Pattern for a Node.js application."
---
::

#### Updating Images and Other Static Assets

Static assets are cached by the CDN (and browsers) for up to 1 year, but every reference
the platform renders is pinned to the content's version. Re-upload an image under the same
name, push the content, and the pages pick up the new file right away - no renaming or
cache-busting needed.

Startup files fetched from `__static__/` work the same way, including the archives that
`labctl` builds from a sibling folder (see the `startupFiles` comments in this tutorial's
front matter): edit the sources, push, and the next playground start gets the new version.

### How to Embed Code Snippets

Inline code elements and code blocks are supported with the standard single- and triple-backtick syntax.
For code blocks, you can optionally specify the language to enable syntax highlighting,
add a (file)name to display in the code block, and highlight specific lines.

Look up the below code snippet in the source of this tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/iximiuz/labs/blob/main/content-samples/sample-tutorial/index.md) to see how it's done:

```yaml [~/my/file.yaml]{2,9-11}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment # highlighted line
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3 # highlighted block
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

### How to Embed Tabbed Code Blocks

iximiuz Labs supports tabbed code blocks with the `tabbed` MDC component:

```markdown
::tabbed
---
tabs:
  - name: tab1
    title: Tab 1
  - name: tab2
    title: Tab 2
group: optional
---
#tab1
...markdown...

#tab2
...markdown...
::
```

::remark-box

The content of each tab is regular markdown and can include any elements supported by the markdown syntax,
including other rich MDC components.
::

Here is an example of a tabbed code block:

::tabbed
---
tabs:
  - name: golang
    title: Go
  - name: python
    title: Python
  - name: javascript
    title: JavaScript
---
#golang
```go
package main

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### How to Embed Visual Boxes for Notes, Details, and Hints

When information doesn't belong to the main flow of the tutorial, but it's still important to mention,
you can use one of the following visual boxes:

#### Remark Box

Used to highlight side notes, warnings, or error messages.
The minimal syntax for a remark box is as follows:

```markdown
::remark-box
<side note text goes here>
::
```

In the full form, you can also specify the kind of the remark box:

```markdown
::remark-box
---
kind: info|warning|error
---

<side note text goes here>
::
```

Examples:

::remark-box
💡 This is an info remark box. The emoji is chosen arbitrarily.
::

::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---

⚠️ This is a warning remark box. The emoji is chosen arbitrarily.
::

::remark-box
---
kind: error
---

❌ This is an error remark box. The emoji is chosen arbitrarily.
::

#### Details Box

A collapsible section for additional details, code snippets, or extended explanations.

```markdown
::details-box
---
:summary: <summary text goes here>
---

<the collapsible section's content goes here>
::
```

The content can be as long as needed and use all the supported markdown elements, except for nested details-boxes.

Example:

::details-box
---
:summary: Click here to expand/collapse the section
---

The collapsible section's content goes here.

::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---

This is a warning remark box inside a details-box 🤯
::

Code blocks are also supported inside details-boxes:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
::

#### Hint Box

Very similar to the `details-box` component, but styled slightly differently and carries different semantics.

```markdown
::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint <number>
---

<hint text goes here>
::
```

Example:

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 1
---

Try running `docker run --help` to see available flags for running containers in detached mode.
::

### How to Embed Challenge Cards

A _challenge card_ is a rich link to the corresponding challenge that shows a preview of the challenge,
some metadata, and a button to start the challenge.
Authors can embed any challenges listed in the public [challenges catalog](/challenges) or prepare their own [challenges](/new/challenge).

Challenges are embedded into the tutorial using the `card` component with the corresponding challenge name:

```markdown
::card
---
# challenges is an object in the tutorial's front matter
:challenge: challenges.<challenge-name>
---
::
```

**Before embedding a challenge, you must list it in the tutorial's Front Matter:**

```yaml
---
kind: tutorial
title: ...

challenges:
  <challenge-name-1>: {}
  <challenge-name-2>: {}
---
```

Examples:

::card
---
:challenge: challenges.docker_101_container_run
---
::

::card
---
:challenge: challenges.kubernetes_pod_with_faulty_init_sequence
---
::

::remark-box
**A challenge name is the last segment of the challenge's URL.** For example, for a challenge located at the following URL:

```text
https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/docker-101-container-run
```

...the challenge name is `docker-101-container-run`.
::

### How to Embed Tutorial Cards

A _tutorial card_ is a rich link to another tutorial - useful for cross-linking related material
or pointing readers to a deeper dive on a specific topic.

Tutorials are embedded into the tutorial using the same `card` component as challenges,
but with the `:content` attribute pointing into the front matter `tutorials` map:

```markdown
::card
---
# tutorials is an object in the tutorial's front matter
:content: tutorials.<tutorial-name>
---
::
```

**Before embedding a tutorial, you must list it in the tutorial's Front Matter:**

```yaml
---
kind: tutorial
title: ...

tutorials:
  <tutorial-name-1>: {}
  <tutorial-name-2>: {}
---
```

By default, a tutorial card floats to the side of the surrounding text (similar to image boxes),
so the markdown next to the card wraps around it.

Example:

::card
---
:content: tutorials.sample-tutorial
---
::

Some text next to the tutorial card. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut purus eget sapien. Nulla facilisi.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut purus eget sapien. Nulla facilisi.

::remark-box
**A tutorial name is the last segment of the tutorial's URL.** For example, for a tutorial located at the following URL:

```text
https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/sample-tutorial
```

...the tutorial name is `sample-tutorial`.
::

### How to Embed Skill Path Cards

A _skill path card_ is a rich link to a multi-step skill path - a great way to point readers
to a structured learning track that builds on the topic of the tutorial.

Skill paths are embedded with the `card` component and the `:content` attribute pointing into the
front matter `skill-paths` map:

```markdown
::card
---
# skill-paths is an object in the tutorial's front matter
:content: skill-paths.<skill-path-name>
---
::
```

**Before embedding a skill path, you must list it in the tutorial's Front Matter:**

```yaml
---
kind: tutorial
title: ...

skill-paths:
  <skill-path-name-1>: {}
  <skill-path-name-2>: {}
---
```

By default, a skill path card floats to the side of the surrounding text (similar to image boxes),
so the markdown next to the card wraps around it.

Example:

::card
---
:content: skill-paths.sample-skill-path
---
::

Some text next to the skill path card. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut purus eget sapien. Nulla facilisi.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut purus eget sapien. Nulla facilisi.

**A skill path name is the last segment of the skill path's URL.** For example, for a skill path located at the following URL:

```text
https://labs.iximiuz.com/skill-paths/sample-skill-path
```

...the skill path name is `sample-skill-path`.
::

### How to Embed Playground Cards

A _playground card_ is a rich link to a standalone playground that shows a preview of the playground,
some metadata, and a button to start it.
Authors can embed any playgrounds listed in the public [playgrounds catalog](/playgrounds) or their own [custom playgrounds](/playgrounds?filter=my-custom).

Playgrounds are embedded into the tutorial using the same `card` component as challenges,
but with the `:playground` attribute instead of `:challenge`:

```markdown
::card
---
# playgrounds is an object in the tutorial's front matter
:playground: playgrounds.<playground-name>
---
::
```

**Before embedding a playground, you must list it in the tutorial's Front Matter:**

```yaml
---
kind: tutorial
title: ...

playgrounds:
  <playground-name-1>: {}
  <playground-name-2>: {}
---
```

By default, a playground card floats to the side of the surrounding text (similar to image boxes),
so the markdown next to the card wraps around it.

Examples:

::card
---
:playground: playgrounds.docker
---
::

Some text next to the playground card. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut purus eget sapien. Nulla facilisi.

::card
---
:playground: playgrounds.ubuntu_24_04
---
::

More text next to the playground card. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut purus eget sapien. Nulla facilisi.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed ut purus eget sapien. Nulla facilisi.

::remark-box
**A playground name is the last segment of the playground's URL.** For example, for a playground located at the following URL:

```text
https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds/ubuntu-24-04
```

...the playground name is `ubuntu-24-04`.
::

### How to Embed a Grid of Cards

When you want to show a collection of related challenges, tutorials, skill paths, or playgrounds side by side,
use the `grid` component. It arranges its items in a responsive grid where all cards in a row share the same height.

```markdown
::grid
---
items:
  - challenge: challenges.<challenge-name>
  - content: tutorials.<tutorial-name>
  - content: skill-paths.<skill-path-name>
  - playground: playgrounds.<playground-name>
---
::
```

Each item must reference an entry already declared in the front matter under the corresponding key
(`challenges`, `tutorials`, `skill-paths`, `playgrounds`, etc.).

Example:

::grid
---
items:
  - challenge: challenges.docker-101-container-run
  - challenge: challenges.kubernetes-pod-with-faulty-init-sequence
  - content: tutorials.sample-tutorial
  - content: skill-paths.sample-skill-path
  - playground: playgrounds.docker
  - playground: playgrounds.ubuntu-24-04
---
::


## Adding a Playground to the Tutorial

With every tutorial, you have the option to attach a remote playground -
allowing users to run commands in a browser-based or SSH-accessible environment.
To attach a playground to a tutorial, specify the playground name in the tutorial's Front Matter as follows:

```yaml
---
kind: tutorial
title: ...

playground:
  name: <playground-name>
---
```

You can choose any iximiuz Labs playground (an [official "base" playground](/playgrounds?filter=base), any of the [community-maintained playgrounds](/playgrounds?filter=community), or [your own custom playground](/playgrounds?filter=my-custom)) and optionally tweak it further by overriding the playground's `machines`, and `tabs` attributes in the tutorial's Front Matter.

Click [here](/playgrounds?filter=all) to see a full list of available playgrounds or run the following command:

```sh
curl -s https://labs.iximiuz.com/api/playgrounds?filter=all \
  | jq -r '.[] | .name + " - " + .description'
```

::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---

⚠️ **The playground you choose is subject to its own access control and usage limits.**
Make sure that it's at least as permissive as the corresponding tutorial's access control policy.
For instance, if the tutorial is publicly accessible, but the playground is private or restricted,
the users will not be able to start the tutorial.
::

While a tutorial can be created without a playground,
it is highly recommended to attach one to enhance the learning experience.
This gives users an interactive environment to execute commands and follow along with the tutorial's practical exercises.

::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---

⚠️ Only tutorials with playgrounds can be **started** and **completed** by iximiuz Labs users.
::

### Customizing Playground Machines

By default, the tutorial will use all the machines defined in the playground's configuration.
If you need to alter the set of machines or customize their behavior,
you can define a `machines` attribute within the `playground` section of the tutorial's Front Matter.

::remark-box

💡 For compatibility reasons, the machine sets of "base" playgrounds are _frozen_.
This includes the hostnames, so you can rely on them in your tutorial markdown and scripts.
To get a list of available machines in a playground, use the following command:

```sh
curl -s https://labs.iximiuz.com/api/playgrounds/<name> \
  | jq -r '.machines[] | .name'
```
::

::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---

⚠️ While machine hostnames are frozen, **no guarantees are made about the machine's IP addresses
and the number of network interfaces per machine**. The only future-proof way to access a machine
over the network is via its hostname - e.g., `ping cplane-01`.
::

The following customization options are available:

- Using only a subset of machines.
- Reducing machine's system resources.
- Changing machine's default user.
- Changing user's welcome message.
- Disabling SSH access to a machine.

For example, here is how the playground of the current tutorial was customized:

```yaml
playground:
  name: k3s

  # Startup files are baked into the playground's machine filesystems before
  # they boot, so it's a perfect place to pre-configure a machine before the
  # very first init task or login session starts. Up to 20 entries per manifest.
  startupFiles:
    - path: /home/laborant/.bashrc
      content: |
        export SOME_ENV_VAR=some-value

        export PS1='\u@\h:\w (overwritten)\$ '

      append: true # skip if the file needs to be overwritten (or created)
      # owner: UID:GID # default: 0:0 if append is false, otherwise the file owner is kept
      # mode: <octal>   # default: "644" if append is false, otherwise the file mode is kept
      machines: [dev-machine] # optional; omitted = every machine of the play

  # List available machines. By default, all playground machines are available,
  # but once you define the `machines` attribute, only the explicitly listed
  # subset of machines will be added to the playground.
  machines:
  - name: dev-machine
    # Override default resources (cannot be above the limits of the playground)
    resources:
      cpuCount: 1
      ramSize: "1Gi"
    # users: ...
    # noSSH: ...

  - name: cplane-01
    # Override the default login user and set a custom welcome message.
    users:
    - name: root
      default: true
      # Use a special value '-' to disable the welcome message completely.
      welcome: Welcome to the control plane node.

  - name: node-01
    # Include machine in the playground but disable SSH access to it
    # (automatically disables the terminal UI tab).
    noSSH: true

  # This machine is intentionally not listed, meaning that it won't be available
  # in the content's playground (even though it's part of the base playground).
  # - name: node-02
```

### Controlling UI Tabs

By default, every machine in the playground is allocated a `terminal` tab in the UI.
However, authors can customize which tabs are visible.
Beyond the `terminal`, the following types of tabs are available:

- **IDE** (`kind: ide`): A built-in online IDE for coding environments (powered by [coder/code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server)).
- **Kubernetes Visual Explorer** (`kind: kexp`): A visual explorer for Kubernetes-specific tutorials (powered by [iximiuz/kexp](https://github.com/iximiuz/kexp)).
- **HTTP(s) Port** (`kind: http-port`): To access web applications such as Kubernetes Dashboard, Grafana, or Prometheus UI running in the playground.
- **Web Page** (`kind: web-page`): To embed an external webpage (e.g., an official Kubernetes documentation page) directly within the tutorial.

Once you define the `tabs` attribute, the explicitly listed set of tabs will be used instead of the default ones.

For example, here is how the tabs of the current tutorial are defined:

```yaml
kind: tutorial
title: ...

playground:
  name: k3s

  tabs:
  - kind: ide            # enable the online IDE (code-server)
  - kind: kexp           # enable the Kubernetes Visualizer (kexp)

  - machine: dev-machine # 'dev-machine' and 'cplane-01' are hostnames
  - machine: cplane-01   # 'kind: terminal' is implied

  - kind: http-port      # expose a web app listening on machine's port as an iframe tab
    name: Nginx          # user-defined name of the tab
    number: 30080        # port number to expose
    machine: node-01     # machine to expose the port on
    # tls: true          # enable TLS if the target service uses HTTPS
    # pane: right        # show in the right pane of the split-screen view (default: left)
    # target: window     # or open in a new browser tab instead of an embedded pane
                         # (for pages that refuse to load in an iframe); no pane then

  - kind: web-page       # embed an external web page as an iframe tab
    name: example.com    # user-defined name of the tab
    url: https://example.com
    # pane: right        # same options are available for web-page tabs
    # target: window
```

Any tab can be placed in the right pane of the split-screen view with `pane: right` (the default is `left`) -
handy for showing a web UI next to a terminal from the very first second of the playground's life.

Not every web page can be embedded in an iframe, though - many sites send `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` headers that forbid framing,
and some apps simply misbehave when framed. For such cases, set `target: window` on an `http-port` or `web-page` tab:
the tab still shows up in the playground's tab bar, but clicking it opens the page in a new browser tab instead of an embedded pane
(the default is `target: pane`). Since such tabs live outside the page, they take no `pane`.

### Interacting with Tabs from Markdown

You can **activate a certain tab (by its ID, name, or machine) from the markdown** using the inline `tab` component.
Here is an example:

```markdown
Run this command from the :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'}:

...

Then, switch to the :tab{text='IDE' name='IDE'}...
```

And here is how it looks when rendered:
Run this command from the :tab{text='dev-machine' machine='dev-machine'}...
Then, switch to the :tab{text='IDE' name='IDE'}...

It is also possible to **create new tabs dynamically**, but at the moment, only `terminal` tabs are supported:

```markdown
Run this command from a :tab{text='new terminal' machine='cplane-01' :new=true}...
```

Here is how it looks when rendered:
Run this command from a :tab{text='new terminal' machine='cplane-01' :new=true}...

### Exposing Ports Inline

You can [automatically expose HTTP/HTTPS ports from the playground](/docs/playgrounds/expose-http-ports) using the `http-port` component.
This creates a clickable link that opens a new browser tab with the web application running in the playground on the specified port.
This is particularly helpful when you want users to access web applications or services running in the playground without having them go through the port exposure UI.

Here are some examples:

```markdown
# Simple case:
:http-port{text='click here to expose the port' port=9090}

# For a specific machine:
:http-port{text='open app on dev-machine' port=8080 machine='dev-machine'}

# For public access:
:http-port{text='open public dashboard' port=3000 public=true}

# For TLS-enabled application:
:http-port{text='open public dashboard' port=6443 https=true}
```

And here is how it looks when rendered:

Access the service via :http-port{text='Nginx on port 30080' port=30080 machine='node-01'}...
Then open the :http-port{text='development server' port=8080 machine='dev-machine'} to see your app.

::remark-box
The above example assumes that the Nginx service is running on the `node-01` machine in the playground,
its port 80 is published to the VM's `0.0.0.0:30080` address, and then forwarded to the `dev-machine` machine as `8080`.
::

### Playground Container Registry

Each playground has a private container registry that is used to store images for the tutorial.
It's a handy way to transfer images between playground VMs, or from a playground VM into a Kubernetes cluster deployed in the playground.

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/mini-lan.png
:alt: 'A multi-node playground example: 4 VMs and 1 ephemeral container registry sitting in the same LAN.'
:max-width: 600px
---

_A multi-node playground example: 4 VMs and 1 ephemeral container registry sitting in the same LAN._
::

You can access the registry from any machine in the playgrounds using the following address:

```
registry.iximiuz.com
```

By default, the registry allows anonymous access.
To restrict access, you can specify a username and password:

```yaml
playground:
  name: ...
  registryAuth: <username>:<password>
```

::remark-box
💡 Since the registry is available only from the playgrounds,
protecting it with a username and password is not required for most tutorials.
::


## Background Tasks

One of the most powerful features of iximiuz Labs is its **task execution engine**.
Each machine in the playground can run three types of tasks:

- `init`: runs during playground initialization and has no UI representation except for the initial loading screen.
- `helper`: similar to `init`, but doesn't block the playground from starting and can be used during the whole playground's lifetime.
- `regular`: the only user-facing type of tasks that are used to verify specific system conditions and/or accept user input.

Tasks in iximiuz Labs are used to:

- Run scripts to customize the playground's environment.
- Provide dynamic feedback as users follow along the learning material.
- Interact with the user and check that certain actions are performed correctly.

This sample tutorial demonstrates how to use all three types of tasks.
Refer to the [source of this tutorial on GitHub](https://github.com/iximiuz/labs/blob/main/content-samples/sample-tutorial/index.md)
to see how the tasks are defined in the tutorial's Front Matter.

### Initialization Task

An `init` task runs during playground initialization (before the UI is fully available).
It's vital for setting up the environment but is not reflected in the user interface.
For example:

```yaml
---
kind: tutorial
title: ...

playground:
  name: ...

tasks:
  init_deploy_nginx:
    # Init tasks are used to finalize the setup of the playground.
    # Until all init tasks are completed, the playground screen shows
    # a loading animation.
    init: true

    # By default, the task is executed on every machine of the playground.
    # If the task needs to be executed only on a specific machine, you
    # can specify it with the `machine` property. Beware, at the moment,
    # either none or all tasks must have the `machine` property (in the latter case,
    # different tasks may be executed on different machines).
    machine: dev-machine

    # By default, tasks are executed as the `root` user.
    # If the task needs to be executed as a different user, you
    # can specify it with the `user` property.
    user: laborant

    run: |
      kubectl run nginx-01 --image=ghcr.io/iximiuz/labs/nginx:alpine --port=80
```

### Regular Verification Task

Definition of a regular task in the Front Matter is identical to that of an init task (except for the `init: true` part).
However, regular tasks also have a corresponding markdown representation via a `simple-task` component:

```markdown
::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: <task-name>
---
#active
<what needs to be done / what system condition needs to be met>

#completed
<what has been done or any other confirmation of completion>
::
```

The `simple-task` component provides a visual representation of the task's progress and _dynamic hints_ (if any).
Here's how it looks:

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_file_exists
---
#active
Waiting for `/tmp/some/file.txt` to be created...

#completed
Nailed it! The file has appeared 🎉
::

The above component is bound to the following task definition in the Front Matter (via the `name` property):

```yaml
tasks:
  # Regular tasks are used to check if certain system conditions are met
  # and/or requested user actions are completed. Each regular task should
  # have a visual representation in the content's body, and the total/done
  # number of regular tasks is displayed in the content's header, serving
  # as a main content completion indicator.
  verify_file_exists:
    machine: dev-machine
    # The only mandatory property of a regular task is the `run` script.
    # The task will be executed in a loop until it exits with 0.
    run: |
      if [ ! -f /tmp/some/file.txt ]; then
        echo "This is a diagnostic message. The user won't see it, but it's helpful for debugging."
        exit 1
      fi
```

Try making the task to pass by executing the following command:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/some && echo "Hello, world!" > /tmp/some/file.txt
```

::remark-box
💡 Make sure you're executing the command from the `dev-machine` (and not any other machine in the playground).
::

### User-Input Task

A _user-input_ task is an alternative way to visualize a regular task.
It is used when the task requires the user to submit specific data (for example, reading a value from a log).
The input is validated, and if correct, it's passed to the corresponding task for further processing:

```markdown
::user-input-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: <task-name>
:validateRegex: <optional regular expression, applied on the client-side>
:destination: <optional path to a file to store the input in the playground VM>
---
#active
<what needs to be entered by the user>

#completed
<confirmation of completion>
::
```

Here's an example of a user-input task UI element:

```markdown
::user-input-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: input_container_name
:validateRegex: ^[0-9a-zA-Z-]{2,64}$
:destination: /tmp/container-name.txt
---
#active
Enter the name of the future container:

#completed
Nice one! You certainly have a good taste in names 🎉
::
```

::user-input-task
---
:tasks: tasks

Under the hood, the above `user-input-task` component is bound to the another _regular_ task from the tutorial's Front Matter:

```yaml
tasks:
  ...
  # Tasks can also be used to collect user input. While it's up to the task's
  # author to decide what to do with the input, the input is usually done via
  # some well-known file (the task's UI element and the task's `run` script
  # should agree on the file name beforehand).
  # The task's `run` script can do anything with the provided user input.
  input_container_name:
    machine: dev-machine
    # This task just echoes the user input (but usually, you'd want to assert
    # something about the input).
    run: |
      # User input is available in the `x(.input)` template variable.
      echo "x(.input)"

      # If the `destination` property is set, user input is also stored in the file.
      cat /tmp/container-name.txt

      if [[ "x(.input)" != "my-awesome-container" ]]; then
        echo "The container name is not as awesome as it should be."
        exit 1
      fi

    hintcheck: |
      echo "The container name is not as awesome as it should be."
      echo "Try using 'my-awesome-container'."
```

Submit any valid container name to see the task to pass.

### Task Dependencies

Tasks can depend on each other.
For example, the following task depends on the `input_container_name` task:

```yaml
tasks:
  ...
  verify_container_is_running:
    machine: dev-machine
    # Regular tasks run only after all init tasks are completed.
    # By default, regular tasks run in parallel but the execution order
    # can be controlled with the `needs` property.
    needs:
      - input_container_name
    env:
      # A handy way to pass the output of a previous task to the current one
      # is to use the a template variable x(.needs.task_name.stdout|stderr).
      # This example illustrates how to pass the output of the `input_container_name`
      # task to the `verify_container_is_running` task.
      - CONTAINER_NAME=x(.needs.input_container_name.stdout)
    # The task engine also defines a number of higher-level helper functions
    # that can be used in the `run` script. For example, `docker_container_is_running`
    # is a helper function that checks if a container is running.
    run: |
      if ! docker_container_is_running ${CONTAINER_NAME}; then
        echo "The container isn't running."
        exit 1
      fi
```

Notice how the `needs` property is used to control the order of task execution
and to access the output of (one of) the previous task(s) if needed.

Make the below task to pass by running the following command:

```sh
docker run -d --name NAME nginx:alpine
```

::simple-task

:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_container_is_running

You can register your own helper functions by creating shell scripts in the following location:

```sh
/opt/iximiuz-labs/examiner/checks.d

### Dynamic Hints and Failure Conditions

Sometimes, you may want to provide a hint to the user that depends on their actions in the playground.
It can be done by defining a `hintcheck` script for the task.
The content of the `hintcheck` script stdout and stderr will be displayed in the corresponding `simple-task` UI element as a so called _dynamic hint_.

Here is an example:

```yaml
tasks:
  ...
  # Ready tasks are executed in a loop until they either complete (exit with 0)
  # or fail (exiting with a non-zero code doesn't mean failure, see failcheck for
  # details). There is a small delay between consecutive executions of the task
  # (currently 1 second, but it's subject to change).
  verify_container_is_stopped:
    machine: dev-machine
    needs:
      - input_container_name
      - verify_container_is_running
    env:
      - CONTAINER_NAME=x(.needs.input_container_name.stdout)
    run: |
      if docker_container_is_running ${CONTAINER_NAME}; then
        echo "The container is still running."
        exit 1
      fi

      if ! docker ps -a | grep -q ${CONTAINER_NAME}; then
        echo "The container is completely gone."
        exit 1
      fi

    # Hintcheck is an optional run-like script that is executed after
    # the task's `run` script. The exit code of the hintcheck script
    # has no effect on the task's outcome. Any output of the hintcheck
    # script (stdout and stderr) gets showed in the task's UI element as
    # a dynamic hint.
    hintcheck: |
      if docker_container_is_running ${CONTAINER_NAME}; then
        echo "The container is still running."
        echo "Run 'docker stop ${CONTAINER_NAME}' to stop it."
      fi

    # Failcheck is an optional run-like script that is executed before
    # the task's `run` instructions to validate that some critical
    # (playground-wide) conditions are still met. If the failcheck exits
    # with a non-zero exit code, the task is considered failed, and the whole
    # playground transitively is marked as failed, too (i.e., the user will
    # have to restart the current content attempt).
    failcheck: |
      if ! docker ps -a | grep -q ${CONTAINER_NAME}; then
        echo "The container has been removed. You shouldn't have done that!"
        echo "Please, restart the tutorial and try again."
        exit 1
      fi
```

Another handy feature of the task engine is the ability to define a _failure condition_ for a task.
It can be done by defining a `failcheck` script for the task.
The content of the `failcheck` script stdout and stderr will also be displayed in the corresponding `simple-task` UI element,
but, unlike the `hintcheck`, if the `failcheck` scripts exits with a non-zero exit code, the whole playground will be marked as failed,
and the user will have to restart the content attempt.

Here is an example:

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_container_is_stopped
---
#active
Waiting for the container to be stopped...

#completed
Nailed it! The container is stopped 🎉
::

Try failing the task by running the following command:

```sh
docker rm -f NAME
```

### Debugging Tasks

Oftentimes, tasks' scripts should be kept secret from the users as they can provide excessive details about the expected user actions
(might be less important for Tutorials, but is crucial for Challenges, where the users are expected to come up with the right commands on their own).

Tasks are executed by a daemon process called `examinerd`, which runs on each machine in the playground.
By default, this daemon hides all the stdout and the stderr output of the tasks' scripts.
However, content authors can access the output of all tasks by either using the `examinerctl` CLI tool or the _Tasks Dev Tools_ UI element.

To activate the Tasks Dev Tools, find the `Tasks` button in the bottom-right corner of the playground and click on it.


## Instead of Conclusion

Remember:

- **Titles are 80% of success** - take your time to craft a good one.
- **Keep it short and concise** - avoid fluff and keep the text to the point.
- **Use concrete words and provide examples** - they make the tutorial testifiable (and falsifiable).
- **Use bullet points and lists** - they make the text more readable and engaging.
- **Use (lots of) images** - a picture is indeed worth a thousand words.
- [**Explain what you're going to explain, how, and why**](https://lucasfcosta.com/2021/09/30/explaining-in-writing.html) - this pattern works so well!
- [**Beware of the "But & Therefore rule"**](https://nathanbweller.com/creators-of-south-park-storytelling-advice-but-therefore-rule/) - it works even for technical writing.


Happy authoring!
